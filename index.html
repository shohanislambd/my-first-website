    <p>Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known,
       is dummy text used in laying out print, graphic
       or web designs. The passage is attributed to an
       unknown typesetter in the 15th century who is thought
       to have scrambled parts of Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum
       et Malorum for use in a type specimen book.</p>
